      <p>
        First off, your cursor tells you a lot of information that you will
        later become naturally accustomed to. An arrow means it is your turn,
        while a bright arrow says something can be selected or dragged. A
        filled, octagon, stop sign means it is not your turn, while a dotted
        octagon means you have to wait for an effect to finish. An X means you
        can not interact with that piece. An exploded asterisks means it has now
        become your turn again. You don&apos;t need to memorize these cursors,
        for it becomes natural after only a few minutes of playing. This is
        merely an explanation.

        Reading Power Descriptions:
      </h1>
      <p>
        When you get a Power Orb, you can read the name of the power on your
        cursor. Also, a brief description appears in the Power Menu to the
        right. This description will scroll away after a few seconds, so
        position your cursor over it to hold it open. If you want to re-read a
        description, click on the question mark listed next to powers, either in
        the cursor pop up menu, big Power Menu, or by clicking on a recently
        used power in the chat window. The Power Descriptions can be turned off
        in the Arena Menu.
      </p>

      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 mt-6">Using a Power:</h1>
      <p>
        Quickly click on a piece that has a power to bring up and lock onto the
        pop up power menu, and then click on the power name. You can also view a
        master list of all your powers in the big Power Menu to the right. If
        you click on a power listed there, you can view what pieces possess that
        power. You can then click on the highlight to activate that power.
      </p>

      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 mt-6">Chatting</h1>
      <p>
        You can type anywhere in the game while you are playing and send a
        message to your opponent. Just type and hit ENTER. This is where you do
        all your smack talk.

      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 mt-6">Visual Cues:</h1>
      <p>
        Analog dial counters at the top of the board tell you how many pieces
        are left for each player. The flashing colored light next to a name
        tells you who is up (in case you forgot). The 7 red LED&apos;s is a
        countdown system to tell you when new Power Orbs will be appearing in
        the Arena. New Orbs appear every 7 rounds. The 5 red LED&apos;s
        symbolize how many Power Orbs will be appearing after the next 7 rounds
        have been played. You can use these two systems of lights to gauge when
        and how many Power Orbs will be appearing. Most games have a time limit
        in order to force you to take action, or begin losing pieces. The timer
        countdown is displayed underneath the chat window as a series of red
        LED&apos;s.
